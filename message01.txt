            Mandelzoom: Efficiency and Testing


Hi Folks, 

I am writing to send you tips about writing your "mandelzoom" programs:

1. There are two things you should do to make your program efficient.
First, as your program computes the color of each point in the window,
it should store the color in an array. Each time you redraw the image,
the program will use the array of precomputed colors, and will not go
through the long process of recomputing the color of each point. Of
course, whenever the user changes the region of the complex plane being
viewed, your program will recompute all of the colors. Second, try to
avoid using the square root function in the <cmath> library.  It's
computationally expensive and you don't need it.

2. Once you get your program running, test it using the parameters:
xMin = -2.0, xMax = 0.5 yMin = -1.25 yMax = 1.25 xs = 400 ys = 400". 
Your image should look like the image in the file "mandelbrot.gif" 
on the class web page, perhaps with different colors.
